Autoschema Database Package
===========================

Autoschema is a database managment system for laravel 4.

It is an alternative to Laravels built in **migrations** component and uses a schema builder to manipulate database tables and views based on a configuration file.

The configuration files are placed in an **app/autoschema** directory and use a similar syntax to migrations.

More information to come I hope...
